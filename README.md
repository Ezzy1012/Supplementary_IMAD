The purpose of the app the app is to allow many people to keep up their good health by capturing how much water they take in a day whilst getting feedback on whether they have ad enough water for the day to maintain hydrated. In light of many people dying from severe dehydration I sought it only fitting to create an app that would allow people to track their daily intake of water. This app is fun, free and most importantly….benefits everyone. 
The app has 3 screens:
The splash screen:
 
 
The splash screen is the first of the three screens which invites you to the app with its logo and gives you   an option to either continue to the next screen or to exit the app completely. 
The main screen:
 
 
The main screen is as it sounds…the main screen. The screen is highly detailed with specific components for the user to fill in in order for the app to work. Should one of the details not be filled in, the user will be given a  message to either fill it in or leave the app. There are additional components too, such as allowing notes to be taken about the water they drank or the exercise they did in the day.
The detailed view screen:
 
 
 
The last screen may not look pleasing, in fact it may even look blank, however I assure you once all the details have been met the screen will fill up with a lot of data which consists of, the average water a person has drank for he day and for the week and the additional notes for said person.
